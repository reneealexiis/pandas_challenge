# Project Overview
Acting as the new Chief Data Scientist for my city’s school district, I was tasked with helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. 
I was tasked with analyzing the district-wide standardized test results. I was able to aggregate the data to showcase trends in school performance. 

## Analysis
Overall, you can see that in general, the passing scores for reading are higher than the passing scores for math and so more attention should be put into helping with math, across the board. You can also see that the passing average for both categories (regardless of type of school), can improve as it’s currently 65.17%.
If you look at the top 3 schools and compare it to the bottom 3 schools, for overall passing scores, you can draw the following conclusions. The top 3 schools with the highest overall passing % are all charter schools, whereas the top 3 schools with the lowest overall passing % are district schools. Using these same examples, you can see that the number of students in the top 3 for the lowest overall passing have a significantly higher number of students than the top 3 for the highest overall passing scores. From this information, you can draw the following conclusions. Since the number of students in the district schools is higher, each student may not be provided the same level of attention or resources as those in charter schools, regardless of the individual student budgets. Moreover, the district schools must abide by state or local government rules/performance standards whereas charter schools operate autonomously, and so you must take this into account when comparing the scores as they are running off different curriculums. In general, you see a larger variance in the average math scores, than you do in the average reading scores. This adds to the first point that overall, more attention should be placed into helping students with math.

### Instructions to Final Work
I was able to successfully create and run the code, using help from the Xpert AI Assistant and tracking progress/accuracy against the starter sample file. All codes are running correctly, and only 2 with warnings.
I did not work with any other students on the assignment, I simply adjusted scripts run by the AI assistant. 

You may find the final version, including my analysis/written report in the Jupyter notebook labeled "PyCitySchools_Notebook" in the PyCitySchools folder.

Thank you!
