# pandas_challenge

I was able to successfully create and run the code, using help from the Xpert AI Assistant and tracking progress/accuracy against the starter sample file. All codes are running correctly, and only 2 with warnings.
I did not work with any other students on the assignment, I simply adjusted scripts run by the AI assistant. 

You may find the final version, including my analysis/written report in the Jupyter notebook labeled "PyCitySchools_Notebook".

Thank you!
